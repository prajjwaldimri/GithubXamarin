Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. This design means that your applications can use the libraries\u0027 features and still be compatible with devices running older versions of Android.\n\nIncluding the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered a best practice for application developers, depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users. \n\n\n\n","Version":"24.2.1.0","Summary":"Provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.","QuickStart":"v13 Support Library\n===================\n\nThis library is designed to be used for Android 3.2 (API level 13) and higher.
